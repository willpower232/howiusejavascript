# howiusejavascript

How I currently use JavaScript with no reliance on jQuery.

Being a big fan of `classList`, sometimes you'll need a polyfill. I like this one:

```html
<!--[if lte IE 9]>
	<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/polyfills/polyfill.js+clsls"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

N.B. you may hate all of this but it is more of a reference for myself than anything.
